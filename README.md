# Multigear_Resampler
Supporting materials for an R script that calculates the expected percentage of species detected by each combination of gears and effort nested within multi-gear ecological survey designs. This script was used in Dunn and Paukert (in press) to identify the most efficient protocol (i.e., fewest sub-samples) that on average detected 90% of species within non-wadeable rivers. Supplementary material 3 in Dunn and Paukert (in press) overviews the R script using a fish survey from the Black River, Missouri.
